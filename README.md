# Welltok HipChat Emoticons

We've expanded on the core set of [emoticons included with HipChat](http://hipchat-emoticons.nyh.name).

## Creating your own emoticons

We are using HipChat's built-in emoticon feature, which means an admin must upload the image in order for it to start showing up. However, you can still create a pull request to get your icon into the repo, then let a HipChat admin know. (Helpful tool for creating GIFs [EZgif animated GIF resizer](http://ezgif.com/resize))

* Max dimensions are 30px tall and 30px wide
* Use a transparent PNG or animated GIF for best results
* Images must be under 100Kb
* Currently limited to 100 custom emoticons
